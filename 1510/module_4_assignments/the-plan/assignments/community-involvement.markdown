# Community Involvement

## Being Visible
  - List 3 Meetup groups in the area you plan to move to
    - For each meetup:
      - List the sponsors if they share any
      - Link to an upcoming Meetup you'd be interested in attending
      - List any organizers that you know or recognize
      - Come up with 3 ways you could be more involved e.g. TAing a GirlDevelopIt class, teaching a Beginner's Track, giving a talk on a topic

      1. [Built In Brews](http://www.meetup.com/Built-In-Brews/events/229764379/) - Boulder, May 12th
        LogRythm a cyber crime-fighting organization. I'm really interested to hear the talks!
      2. The Next NodeJS MeetUp - Still being planned, apparently.
      3. The next DenverRB MeetUp - I recently went to the BoulderRB meetup and it's always really interesting to talk with other developers and hear their stories about what they're working on, where they come from, etc.

      I'm looking forward to being regularly involved with events at Turing, from TAing GDI or giving extra curricular talks on topics I (hopefully) get really good at. Hah.  

  - Do you have a blog? (If not, create one - I suggest medium.com)
    - Come up with 3 blog post ideas
      1. I might start a blog about the transition from non coder to student to TA as a way to document my growth/learning.
      2. As mentioned in my other post (goals.md) I want to get really comfortable with React, documenting pieces of the library that I find interesting/difficult might be a good way to really get into it
      3. That's all I've got right now.

  - For the area you plan to move, are there any developer community Slack channels? If so, how can you join them?

## Staying Involved
  - How do you plan to stay involved with Turing after graduation?
    - Funny Story...I'm not leaving! I'll be hanging out in the basement, either of them, forever. You're welcome.
  - Do you plan on mentoring, if so have you contacted Mary?
    - I'm not going to be an official mentor, but obviously I'm there to help get everyone through what they need to do.
  - Do you plan to stay in touch with any of your mentors?
    - I'd like to. We lost touch towards the end of mod 2 but he was a really great resoure and I'd love to do ruby problems with him.
  - How do you plan/hope to stay in touch with your cohort?
    - 1510 is like an arranged marriage...you may not start out madly in love but you grow into and there's really no getting out of it.

## Summary
  - Define 3 goals for community involvement over the next six months
    1. One of my main concerns with taking this TA role is not knowing enough to help other students. Everything comes with practice, and I know the place I'm at right this minute is the worst it's going to be in terms of my base of knowledge. I want to stay involved with as many things as I can to really keep a well rounded awareness of topics and technologies.
    2. This means attending meetups, working with students, refactoring previous projects, building new projects, and not being afraid to work with other instructors or students to get better at the things I'm weak at.
    3. Code! A LOT. Redo projects. Find things I'm bad at and spend time feeling better about them. s
