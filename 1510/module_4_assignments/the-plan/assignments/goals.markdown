# Goals

Whether you're going right into a job, still job hunting, or repeating module 4 - you should work to identify goals for how you want to continue growing technically as a developer.

### Identify

List three individual learning goals that you would like to accomplish over the next year.

  1. After module 1 I really stopped devoting time to improving on basic ruby functionality or algorithmic thinking. After watching everyone go through technical challenges, I'm realizing that I need to get back on that in any language to prepare for all sorts of situations.

  2. I want to get awesome at React.

  3. I want to be able to review code effectively and solve problems without looking like an idiot.

### Define

For each goal:
  - State where you are currently at with this goal
    - e.g. 'I have given a lightning talk on Go', 'I downloaded EMACS', 'I am at an intermediate level with JavaScript'
  - Define what success looks like after 1 year
  - Outline resources for learning
    - List books, blogs, talks, podcasts and courses that would be useful in learning more
    - List mentors you know or places you could find mentors who could help you along the way
        - List meetups and conferences related to this goal (if relevant)
    - List ideas or links to things you could or are currently building to achieve this goal. (check out the side-hustle assignment)
    - List ideas for lightning talks or conference talks that you could give on this topic. (check out the community involvement assignment)
    - List open source projects that relate to this goal (check out the open source assignment)
  - Why is this goal important to you?

  1. Improve algorithmic thinking
    - Currently I haven't done much. Obviously Turing requires a lot of multitasking and exorcisms/basic coding challenges have fallen by the wayside.
    - Success looks like regularly doing exercisms. Lets say 3 times a week, so that they aren't terrifying anymore.
    - Exercisms and Codewars are great resources. I also have a book on technical interview questions that I should do for a given amount of time on the weekends.
    - This is important because the stronger I can be at simple coding challenges the more I can regularly implement that thought process when building a real project. Knowing my options for various ways to solve a small piece of a puzzle is hugely beneficial in efficiently accomplishing a larger goal.

  2. Get awesome at React.
    - I started mod 4 really pumped about front end frameworks and JavaScript. As usual, getting neck deep in projects made me prioritize getting the job done rather than really learning the stuff I was most interested in. I was also intimidated by the quickness other students picked up the things I thought I'd be good at, (cough cough Greenspan cough) so It was a bit of a wounded pride thing too.
    - Success after 1 year means making React my go-to library for building projects with a front end UX. I want it to come naturally.
    - Lovisa, Steve, Greenspan, Dan Winter...honestly lots of my cohort would be great resources for people to pair with or work on projects with.
    - There is always a meet up happening where React is a major thing. I want to make sure I find those.
    - This goal is important because for some weird reason writing in React makes me happy, when I do it right and it's not super hard. I really like what you can do with JavaScript and oddly enough I like the ridiculous semi-colons so getting powerfully good at frameworks that are friends with JS will be sweet.

  3. Review code effectively.
   - I am really bad at this right now, which doesn't bode well for my upcoming role. That being said, I'm not afraid of a challenge and It's something I've needed to improve on for a while.
   - Success after 1 year looks like I can be thrown someone's code base and safely make assumptions about what the developer is trying to accomplish, and ways to make what is happening cleaner.
   - This is going to be more of a personal challenge thing...not sure how much mentors can help although I'm hoping that off the bat I can shadow another instructor and watch how they pick apart issues or know what to look for.
   - I honestly should go back through my own personal projects and refactor what I can. I plan on doing this a lot over next week to re-familiarize myself with the project itself and also learn how to make improvements with a code base I should be familiar with.
   - This is going to be a huge part of my job and I want to be comfortable with it.
